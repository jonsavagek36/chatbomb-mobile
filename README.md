# chatbomb2
Note: Apparently 'Chatbomb' has already been taken as an app name (so weak), so I'll be changing the name.

Revamped version of Chatbomb that utilizes MongoDB

Still in progress, but what I'm currently implementing:
<ul>
<li>New styling and layout (not a priority on the first version)</li>
<li>Replace the Rails API with a MongoDB backend</li>
<li>Implement a Node mailer</li>
<li>More to come...</li>
</ul>
